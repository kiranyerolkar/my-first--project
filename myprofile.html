    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
        This project is a personal web profile created using basic front-end technologies like HTML and CSS.
        It serves as a digital introduction of myself — Kiran Yerolkar — showcasing my background, education,
        skills, interests, and personal journey in the world of technology. The profile design includes responsive
        layout styling, background visuals, and neatly organized sections to enhance readability and visual appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to practice web development fundamentals, demonstrate creativity through
        custom styling, and prepare a strong digital identity that can be expanded into a full portfolio site in
        the future. It reflects my enthusiasm for coding, continuous learning, and my passion for building
        user-friendly digital experiences.
